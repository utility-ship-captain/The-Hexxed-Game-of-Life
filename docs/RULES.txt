LIFE takes place on an orthogonal grid.
Each "cell" in the grid exists in a "populated" or "unpopulated" state.
The program will "iterate," changing the state of the grid.
In each iteration, each cell will simultaneously check the state of itself and its eight neighbors.

If the cell is unpopulated and exactly three neighbors are populated, it will become populated.
If the cell is populated and has two or three populated neighbors, it will remain populated.
In all other instances, the cell will be unpopulated at the end of the iteration.
